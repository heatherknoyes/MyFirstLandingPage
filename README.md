# Unit 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

In this mini-project, I created a landing page for my cats using HTML and CSS. This landing page implements a few user stories that can be found below.

## User Stories

* As a client, I want to view a single webpage that collects a visitor's contact information.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

## Things I Want to Finish

* Get better styling on the link buttons so that they don't have the background color.

* Have the text boxes span a bit further and format them differently.
